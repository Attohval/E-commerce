Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve been working on crafting a modern, high-end landing page for an e-commerce store â€” designed for both beauty and performance.

âœ… Built with: HTML + Tailwind CSS + AOS animations
âœ… Features:

Sleek gradient hero section with smooth text reveal

Animated product cards with hover lift & zoom effects

Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop

Promo banners to highlight offers & discounts

Optimized for a premium shopping experience

I focused on micro-interactions and motion design to create a layout that doesnâ€™t just look good, but feels interactive and engaging.

Hereâ€™s a sneak peek ðŸ‘‡
(You could attach a short GIF or screenshot of the landing page)
